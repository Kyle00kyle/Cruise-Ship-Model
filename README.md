# 🚢 Cruise Ship 3D Model (Blender)

This project is a realistic modern cruise ship 3D model built in **Blender**.  
The goal is to create a large, detailed, and accurate ship with:

- A curved hull  
- 18+ decks  
- Realistic proportions  
- Upper decks, bridge, and pool areas  
- Future interior spaces (engine room, cabins, etc.)

## 🛠 Software Required

- **Blender 5.0+**  
- GitHub Desktop (for collaboration)

## ▶ How to Open the Project

1. Clone or download the repository  
2. Open:

3. If textures are missing:
- File → External Data → Find Missing Files  
- Select the main project folder

## 👥 Collaboration Rules

Because Blender files are binary:

- Only **one person edits** the main file at a time  
- Others should work on **separate copies**  
- Name your files clearly:

cruise_ship_kyle_edit.blend
cruise_ship_friendA.blend


Then changes can be reviewed and merged manually.
